# CSTP1304 The Lo-Grow App Project

## App Description

Lo-Grow farm is a mobile app that is intended for fostering a small local farming community. The goal is to build a close relationship between consumers and local farmers. Local farmers can use Lo-Grow farm to market their products and promote their brilliant farming ideologies via Lo-Grow farmâ€™s community board and their individual profiles. Consumers can easily find and share the latest local farming updates in the community board, follow any farmer whom they find interesting, and be notified for any special events organized by the local farmers, such as sales events, open house events, live music events etc.
